# Zero to Production newsletter

This is my implementation of the newsletter built in the book [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html) by Luca Palmieri.

## Notes

The current implementation covers up to chapter 4.

I wanted to give it a twist and use [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) instead of [actix-web](https://docs.rs/actix-web/latest/actix_web/), but most of the code is straight out of the book with some minor touches here and there.
